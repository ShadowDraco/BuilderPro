# mega-game - (currently with real-time chat)

## Making use of many new libraries, practices, and frameworks to immerse myself in something great

    - Built with React JS, Firebase, Unity5, ChakraUI

### What's new here?

- This project was used to learn Firebase, Chakra UI, and Phaser3 game library.
- I created a _realtime_ chat app that _securely authenticates users and stores messages_ in 'rooms' using **firebase**
- users can log in and go to a room they name to continue chatting where they left off
- I then created the shell of a game using the phaser3 library and then went to work on other things.
- I came back after making _real_ progress in **unity** for games and switched out the phaser game
